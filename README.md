# Wifi-password-stealer
A program to steal all the wifi-passswords from a computer to your email.
Imagine yourself in a situation where you donot get the password of a wifi connected to a Windows laptop.
This is the situation where this program can help you.
You would have to just add your email and password in the program in place of "your email" and "your password". After this edit you can just double click the file and you will recieve all the information of all the wireless connections ever connected to the laptop.

Note: The email and password is preferred to be of a hotmail/outlook account.
      There are some issues with the Google mail account.
      The target laptop must have python installed in it.
